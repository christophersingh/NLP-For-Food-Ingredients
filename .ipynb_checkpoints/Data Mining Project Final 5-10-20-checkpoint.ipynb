The British synth-pop band returns to a format that helped make them stars — television — in this made-for-TV documentary, which debuted last year on BBC Four and will make its stateside debut on Showtime Friday night. The program revisits the band’s breakout years, in the 1980s, when their danceable beats, big hair and fashionable music videos (long a ubiquitous presence on MTV) made them household names. It also looks at the group’s work in the decades since. Telling the story are Duran Duran’s four current members (Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Roger Taylor) and interviewees like Cindy Crawford and Boy George. “The ’80s were fabulous to us as a group,” Le Bon told The New York Times in 1995, “then it went down a bit.” Expect him to elaborate on both of those experiences here.A documentary about the British synth-pop band Duran Duran debuts on Showtime.
